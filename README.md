### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at UW-Madison, working on the interface between modern deep-learning and fundamental physics, with a focus on Higgs boson measurements at the ATLAS experiment at CERN.

I am also part of the [Institute of Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP)](https://iris-hep.org), where I participate in building an analysis system focused on Neural Simulation-Based Inference (NSBI).

My most recent work with NSBI:

- Measurement of off-shell Higgs boson production in the $H^*\rightarrow ZZ\rightarrow 4\ell$ decay channel using a neural simulation-based inference technique in 13 TeV $pp$ collisions with the ATLAS detector (arXiv: [2412.01548](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01548))

- An implementation of neural simulation-based inference for parameter estimation in ATLAS (arXiv: [2412.01600](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01600))

For contributions to the ATLAS internal code, see [gitlab](https://gitlab.cern.ch/jsandesa).
