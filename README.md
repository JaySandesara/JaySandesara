### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student working towards unravelling the mysteries of nature by using modern deep-learning techniques to probe the fundamental interactions inside the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider of CERN. My main project is building a practical simulation-based inference framework for the ATLAS experiment data analysis, and is expected to be public soon. Stay tuned! 

For ATLAS members, my internal projects can be accessed via Gitlab: https://gitlab.cern.ch/jsandesa
