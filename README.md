### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student working on the interface between modern deep-learning and high energy physics. My main focus is application to data from the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider of CERN. 

My current project is building a practical simulation-based inference framework for the ATLAS experiment data analysis, and is expected to be made public soon. Stay tuned! 

See the simulation-based inference computing workflow paper (code to be made public soon): https://cds.cern.ch/record/2865243/files/ATL-COM-SOFT-2023-101.pdf

For ATLAS members, my internal projects can be accessed via Gitlab: https://gitlab.cern.ch/jsandesa
